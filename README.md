# Carpooling-Application

# **1. Introduction**
**Purpose**: The objective of this project is to design and develop a carpooling application that facilitates ride-sharing among users, aiming to reduce travel costs, traffic congestion, and carbon footprint.  
**Background**: Carpooling has emerged as an effective solution for urban transportation challenges. By leveraging technology, this app will connect drivers and passengers traveling along similar routes.  

**Scope**: The project will focus on user authentication, ride search and booking, fare calculation, route optimization, and a feedback mechanism.

# **2. Problem Statement**
**Defined Problem**: Increasing urban traffic and fuel costs highlight the need for efficient ride-sharing solutions. Current options lack features like robust security, accurate route optimization, or flexible cost-sharing.  
**Importance**: Solving this problem can significantly impact environmental sustainability, reduce commuting expenses, and enhance urban mobility.

# **3. Objectives**
- Develop a mobile/web-based application for seamless carpooling services.  
- Implement secure user registration and authentication mechanisms.  
- Integrate features for ride-matching based on real-time data.  
- Optimize routes and dynamically calculate costs.  
- Enable user feedback for quality assurance.

# **4. Methodology**
## Data Collection  
Gather datasets related to traffic, popular routes, and cost estimations (if applicable).  

## Tools/Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python, JavaScript (React Native for mobile apps).  
- **Backend**: Node.js or Django/Flask.  
- **Database**: Firebase, MongoDB.  
- **Mapping**: Google Maps API.

## Implementation
### Phase 1:  
Set up the environment and develop user authentication.  
### Phase 2:  
Create ride-matching and route optimization algorithms.  
### Phase 3:  
Integrate a payment gateway and feedback system.

## Timeline  
| Phase     | Description                                                        | Timeline  |  
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|  
| Phase 1   | Develop login page with user role selection (Driver/Rider)         | TBD - TBD |  
| Phase 2   | Build the driver portal: Post rides (location, date, time, seats)  | TBD - TBD |  
| Phase 3   | Build the rider portal: Search and book rides based on criteria    | TBD - TBD |  
| Phase 4   | Implement database storage for ride history                       | TBD - TBD |  
| Phase 5   | Integration, testing, and deployment                              | TBD - TBD |  

## Milestones  
### Milestone 1:  
Create a login page with options to select Driver or Rider. Redirect users to their respective portals after login.  
### Milestone 2:  
Build the Driver Portal to allow drivers to post rides with:  
- Pickup/Drop-off location  
- Date and time  
- Number of available seats  

### Milestone 3:  
Develop the Rider Portal where users can:  
- Search for nearby rides based on location and date  
- View relevant ride information (driver name, available seats, etc.)  
- Book rides  

### Milestone 4:  
Implement a Database to store:  
- Ride history for riders (past rides taken)  
- Ride history for drivers (past rides posted)  

### Milestone 5:  
Integrate and test all components, ensuring smooth navigation and functionality.

# **6. Expected Deliverables**
- Functional login page with driver/rider role selection.  
- Separate Driver Portal and Rider Portal.  
- Search and booking functionality for riders.  
- Ride posting functionality for drivers.  
- Database storing ride history for users and drivers.
